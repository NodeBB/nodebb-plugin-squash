nodebb-plugin-squash
======================

Allow superusers to mark members of your NodeBB forum as trolls to squash their posts (silencing them). They will still be able to post and view their own posts, but other users on your forum (including guests) will not be able to read them.

This plugin requires the superuser plugin installed and activated.
